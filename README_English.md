What's TUBAME
==============

TUBAME provides follwing useful informations for your migration.

* Application codes that could be unavailable or deprecated on the target middleware (JBoss EAP6, etc.) - Dependency Searching Function
* HowTo and Workload for modifiying configurations that could be needed for your applications to run on the target middleware - Knowledge-Based Searching Function

How do I run TUBAME?
==============

TUBAME is the Eclipse Plugin. So all you have to do for using TUBAME is to put it's binaries into Eclipse plugins folder.  
The Dependency Searching Function is ready-to-use as soon as you install it in Eclipse, and also you can use the Knowledge-Based Function without any additional operations if you use Rule-Sets provided by TUBAME community.
Or you can define your own Rule-Set by Knowledge Manager. By using Knowledge Manager you can make detailed Guideline for migration.  

To try and understand TUBAME it's the better way to use Rule-Sets (now JBoss EAP4 to EAP6 available) provided by TUBAME.  
From now on TUBAME will provide Rule-Sets gradually, such as migration on WebLogic to JBoss EAP6.
And we expect and appreciate that you share your own Rule-Sets. Your contribution will make TUBAME fly higher!
